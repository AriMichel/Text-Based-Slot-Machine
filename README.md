# Text-Based-Slot-Machine
Python 


We are going to build a text based slot machine.
The way this will work is the user will deposit a certain amount of money. We're then going to allow them to bet on either one, two or three lines of the slot machine, just to keep it pretty simple and then we are going to determine if they won. So if they got any lines, we're going to multiply their bet by the value of the line, add that to their balance, and then allow them to keep playing until they want to cash out or until they run out of money.
